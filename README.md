### Real-Time Car Detection and Tracking

This project performs real-time car detection and tracking in video streams using YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking. The system processes video files, detects cars, tracks their movements, and saves an annotated output video with bounding boxes and unique tracking IDs.

#### Features
- **YOLOv8**: High-performance object detection.
- **DeepSORT**: Efficient multi-object tracking with unique IDs.
- **Customizable**: Can be configured to track other object classes.
- **Video Output**: Annotated video with bounding boxes and tracking information.
